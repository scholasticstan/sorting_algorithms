## 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

Sorting algorithms are methods used to organize data in a specific order, usually either in ascending or descending order. Here are some commonly used sorting algorithms:

Bubble Sort: This algorithm compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm repeats until no more swaps are needed.

Selection Sort: This algorithm selects the smallest element in the array and swaps it with the first element. It then selects the next smallest element and swaps it with the second element, and so on.

Insertion Sort: This algorithm builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It starts with the first element and inserts each subsequent element into its proper place in the sorted array.

Merge Sort: This algorithm divides the array into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves back together.

Quick Sort: This algorithm picks a pivot element, partitions the array into two halves based on the pivot element, recursively sorts each half, and then combines the sorted halves.

Heap Sort: This algorithm builds a max heap from the array and repeatedly extracts the maximum element from the heap and places it at the end of the sorted array.

Each sorting algorithm has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the best algorithm to use depends on the specific situation and data being sorted.
